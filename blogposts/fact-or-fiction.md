<!-- 
I have always had an affinity for films. I can't quite exactly pinpoint when I started or what exactly got me into it. All I know is that sitting down and watching something has been a comfort for me ever since. 

I remember being a kid and looking through my family's makeshift catalogue of DVDs in zipper cases found in our cars. The novelty of watching a movie on the way to school was always an excitement if I wasn't fast asleep. I remember that, without fail, I would watch the then-Shrek trilogy over and over again as if I haven't already watched it last month. I was in awe with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, thinking that one day I too would become a superhero. And, weirdly enough, I enjoyed rewatching Cheaper by the Dozen and  Yours, Mine & Ours for some... reason.

Looking back at this, it is nostalgic to think about the media I consumed as a child. While I can't recall them as vividly anymore, I do remember how they made me feel. And, I don't mean that in a *good* way.

While these movies hold a special place in my heart, I can't help but to think how I used them as a distraction for my troubles. Escapism allows me to fall into my delusions in my life, to keep me safe from harm. Yet, I find that I am capable to control these delusions to a somewhat healthy level. Let me explain.

While I acknowledge my defense mechanisms, I understand that these are not the reality that I live in but only a utopia I only imagine. These delusions help me cope with the actuality of my life, making it possible for me to accept that moment as an instance of goodness in comparison to whatever I may be going through at that time despite it not being real at all. For example, flooding my conscience with films not only pass the time but immerse me into the story for a little bit. They allow me to envision improvements I would like in life blah blah blah -->
