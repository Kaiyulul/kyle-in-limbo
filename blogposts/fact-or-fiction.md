I have always had an affinity for films. I can't quite exactly pinpoint when I started or what exactly got me into it. All I know is that sitting down and watching something has been a comfort for me ever since. 

I remember being a kid and looking through my family's makeshift catalogue of DVDs in zipper cases found in our cars. The novelty of watching a movie on the way to school was always an excitement if I wasn't fast asleep. Looking back at this, it is nostalgic to think about the media I consumed as a kid. While I can't recall them as vividly anymore, I do remember how they made me feel. And, I don't mean that in a necessarily *good* way.

While these movies hold a special place in my heart, I can't help but to think how I used them as a distraction for my troubles. Escapism allows me to fall into my delusions in my life, to keep me safe from harm. Yet, I find that I am capable to control these delusions to a somewhat healthy level. Let me explain.

While I acknowledge my defense mechanisms, I understand that these are not the reality that I live in but only a utopia I only imagine. These delusions help me cope with the actuality of my life, making it possible for me to accept that moment as an instance of goodness in comparison to whatever I may be going through at that time despite it not being real at all. For example, flooding my conscience with films not only pass the time but immerse me into the story for a little bit. They allow me to envision improvements I would like to make in my own life, a profound opportunity for introspection and self-discovery.

The allure of escapism through films is undeniable. With how easy it is to stream these days, I can transport myself to distant galaxies far far away or even witness the glory of superheroes in the fight for society. In the middle of a mundane day, movies offer a respite and act as a temporary sanctuary where I can momentarily detach from reality and lose myself in captivating storylines and vivid cinematography. 

Despite this, I often find myself looking at the black mirror and realizing that this temporary escape is merely a reflection of my own life. With characters grappling with dilemmas and overcoming obstacles, or embarking on transformative journeys that resonate with aspects of my own living experiences. Their triumphs inspire me, their failures caution me, and their vulnerabilities remind me of my own humanity.

Films serve as mirrors, reflecting not just the external world, but also the intricacies of our inner landscapes. Immersion in these narratives not only allow me to ponder on my fears and desires, but also I find that I am drawn to characters that embody traits I admire prompting me to reflect on my own values and aspirations. In the same light, watching characters go through adversity somewhat similar to my own encourages me to face my demons, to stand with resilience and determination.

Films offer a unique lens through which to examing societal issues and moral dilemmas. I often reflect on my own ethics for every fucked-up movie I watch (I'm looking at you Human Centipede 2). They invite me to challenge preconceived notions and broadens my perspectives on things. Cinema encourages me to engage with the world around me and strive for a deeper understanding of human condition.

In this realm of cinematic escapism, I find not just their entertainment but also profound moments of self-reflection and personal growth. Each film viewed becomes a stepping stone in my journey of self-discovery, guiding me towards a clearer understanding of whi I am and who I aspire to be. It allows me to confront my fears, confront my shortcomings, and envision a path towards personal fulfillment.

While it may not be the most healthy ways to cope with my day-to-day life, I embrace the therapy films offer. It is in an immersive form to find not just an escape from reality but a journey of self-explorationâ€”a journey that enriches my life and shapes who I am in the future.

- I created the initial draft back in November 2023. Having been 2 months since then, I have realized more things that I had before.
