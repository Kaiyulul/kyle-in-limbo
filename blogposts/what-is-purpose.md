> Would I be proud of the life I lived if I died tomorrow?

I often find myself reflecting on what I have been doing every so often. Recently, I have been looking at my current first-job-hunt status and how it could have been more uneventful despite my efforts. While it is something my peers can relate to, I can't help but think that maybe I am doing something wrong—that maybe I am just not cut out for it. Yet, I find myself trying anyway despite the uncertainties it entails. 

The journey of seeking my first job has been marked with doubt and regret. Looking back at my time in Ateneo, I should have done more over the pandemic and utilized my free time for working on myself for my future career as opposed to moping around waiting for match queues and binging Modern Family. I could have joined my home organization. I could have done bootcamps. I could have studied better. There are way too many could've-would've-should'ves that haunt me to this day, thoughts that I can't quite shake off. 

Time unemployed prompted self-reflection, looking for answers to my dilemmas. Never thought to journal or to meditate, but evidently boiled down to doing things with purposeful intention. May it not be for my career per se, but more so the act of doing something for a purpose and with an intent to fulfill that makes decisions in my life much more fruitful than they were before. It is about aligning my passion with purpose, embracing challenges that incite growth, and creating opportunities that benefit not only myself but also those around me. Never thought to be a 'neutral good' type of person, but it suits me very well. 

Since then, I have affirmed myself that entering the job market is not an easy feat, but my withstanding resilience highlights my resolve in the face of setbacks. I have set short and long-term goals that reflect my values and aspirations, keeping myself in check if ever I get lost again. And, above all, I am staying true to the freshman I was almost 5 years ago. I have made it this far, I will not stop until I have not reached the top. 

Standing at this threshold of introspection, I choose to greet the future with optimism and determination. Each obstacle has been a lesson, guiding me toward a deeper understanding of myself and my aspirations. While the road to my first job may be winding and fraught with challenges, I am emboldened by the resilience that resides within me. With purposeful intention, I step forward into the unknown, fueled by the belief that every experience—whether triumph or tribulation—is a stepping stone toward my ultimate goal. Here's to embracing the journey with open arms, to chasing dreams with unwavering zeal, and to the endless possibilities that await on the horizon. Every thread of doubt and regret only serves to enrich the mosaic of my life. And with each new day, I am reminded that the best is yet to come.
