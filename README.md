  This is my <a href="https://kyle-in-limbo.vercel.app/" target="_blank"> blog </a> for anything that runs through my noggin'! Not so much a professional blog at the moment, currently just personal trauma dumping or journaling. Feel free to take a peek if you feel like it!

## ðŸ’¬ A lil' sumthin' on the project
  I was prompted to make this project on the need for an output and safe space for me and me only. Integrating some dev-side into making this into a reality, I wanted to try Next.js and TailwindCSS just for the sake of it. The goal wasn't to deploy this publically, but to try something and hope that it works. I can't quite find the specific video I took the base from, but it definitely helped in making the site. However, I'll make sure to add my own pizzazz on future commits.

## ðŸ›  Running locally

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
